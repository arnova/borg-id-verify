-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This script was written specifically for verifying Borg backup "append-only" archives where any archive pruning/compacting is performed server-side. It keeps
track of previously created archives and their IDs and detects unauthorized (malicious) changes of the backup repository. Typically the script should be run
on the server where the Borg backups reside. The flow for its usage is as follows:
1) Run "borg-id-verify /path/to/borg-repos" (without any additional arguments) to check the integrity of the Borg repository;
2) If the repository is ok, perform any Borg pruning/compacting;
3) Run "borg-id-verify /path/to/borg-repos --force" to update all archive IDs afterwards. This is an important step since it makes sure the stored information
   is up-2-date for the "next" verification run.

Note that the script assumes "/path/to/borg-repos" is the root-folder containing one or more Borg repository folders. For additional options run the script with "--help"
